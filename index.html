<p> SUMMARY </p>
</div>

 <p> Films about nature and animal world hold a strong position in
popularity today. Sophisticated filming technology granted the humanity
access to previously unthought of being seen corners of our planet. All
live creatures, including human being, are finding their way to survive
on Earth.
     We are prone to make strong statements about our will to save the
planet AND ourselves from extinction. But do we really translate such
statements into reality?
My mocumentary is about such contradiction. Narrated with the help of
AI by David Attenborough, the film poses a question - 'Where are we
  heading?".</P>
